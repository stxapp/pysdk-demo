# Welcome to SportsX SDK Documentation

# Overview

The STX SDK is a wrapper around the Sportsx Graphql APIs and Phoenix channels.
The SDK provides object-oriented APIs to connect with the available Sportsx APIs and socket channels.

## Compatibility

This library is compatible with the following versions of Python:

 - 3.7
 - 3.8
 - 3.9

## Installation

Install the latest release via pip:

    pip install stx-pysdk

The SDK is built for python 3 only.
If your system has both python2 and python3 manager installed then by default "pip" refers to python2 manager,
so in order to install for python3 "pip3" would be used

    pip3 install stx-pysdk
